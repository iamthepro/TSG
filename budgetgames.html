    <h3>1.Vainglory</h3>
    <p>Vainglory is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game which has a little bit of similarities to the popular MOBAs League of Legends and Dota 2 but designed for smartphones and tablets. As standard for the genre, two opposing teams fight to reach and destroy the enemy's base while defending their own in a tug of war for control of a path, the "lane", which connects the bases. In addition, there is a "jungle" beneath the lane, which contains creatures and objectives that can be killed or captured.</p>

       <p>It is a great game to play,but newcomers may not understand how to play properly which leads to trolling and rage-quitting.Also,it is a very heavy game and needs about 1.5 to 2GB to download.</p><br>

    <p>It is a good game but it is better when played on a PC as the mobile version is buggy and the character is hard to control.You need a lot of real money to look cool and so f2p players also get teased about their looks,but it is very rare.</p><br>
    <h3>3.Shadow fight 3</h3>
    <p>Shadow fight 3 - next game in a series of popular fighting games by Nekki. As before you fight in spectacular battles to defeat your opponent. Choose a character, each with own combat style, advantages and disadvantages. You can fight real time battles or do missions and receive bonuses.</p>

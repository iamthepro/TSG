  <h2>PC Games to Buy</h2>
  <h3>1.Minecraft</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Price-2199 Rs.</li>
    <li>Rating-9/10</li>
    <li>Value for money-6.5/10</li>
    <p>Survival mode is fun when you have all the weapons, but creative just gets boring after some time playing the game.Also, it is very costly for a sandbox game and hence the value for money.</p><br>
<h3>2.CS:GO(Counter Strike Global Offensive)</h3>
  <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve Corporation.There are six main game modes: Competitive, Casual, Deathmatch, Arms Race, Demolition, and Weapons Course.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Price-359 Rs.</li>
      <li>Rating-9.5/10</li>
      <li>Value for money-10/10</li>
      <p>It is a beast game, has great concept and weaponry and has somewhat good graphics.CS:GO is also very cheap for its kind and so the value for money is great.</p><br>
      <h3>3.Rocket League</h3>
      <p>Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has one to four players assigned to each of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Price-899 Rs.</li>
    <li>Rating-9.5/10</li>
    <li>Value for money-9.5/10</li>
    <p>A very enjoyable game overall, especially if you are a fan of fast cars and soccer like me!It is a bit costlier than CS:GO so if you are on a budget this game is not for you. :(</p>

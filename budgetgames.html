    <h3>1.Vainglory</h3>
    <p>Vainglory is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game which has a little bit of similarities to the popular MOBAs League of Legends and Dota 2 but designed for smartphones and tablets. As standard for the genre, two opposing teams fight to reach and destroy the enemy's base while defending their own in a tug of war for control of a path, the "lane", which connects the bases. In addition, there is a "jungle" beneath the lane, which contains creatures and objectives that can be killed or captured.</p>

    <li>Press X to put away your weapon, meaning you can sprint six per cent faster.</li>
    <li>To refuel, the vehicle needs to be compeltely static, but you can still refuel from within the car by right-clicking the cannister in your inventory.</li>
<li>The key things you want to find as soon as possible are the good-in-most-situations auto-rifles (ARs), a backpack, a bulletproof vest, healing items, and a helmet - the higher level for these items, the better.</li>
    <li>You can jump considerably further than usual by running away from a grenade and jumping as it explodes.</li>
    <li>Different items take up different amounts of space in your inventory - First Aid Kits are bigger than bandages, for example. But this also applies to different types of grenades, with Frags smaller than Smoke and Stun grenades for example.</li>
    <li>Jumping whilst melee attacking makes headshots easier, and yes, headshot punches and swings with melee weapons do considerably more damage.</li>
    <li> If you know a fight is coming, or need to sprint across a dangerous open area, use a 'boost' item like Painkillers or Energy Drinks, as the healing over time and extra speed can be crucial.</li>
    <li> Grenades are perfect for clearing small huts (if you can get one through the little windows) and buildings where you suspect someone is camping.</li
    <li>Avoid using Smoke grenades though - they give away your position and the smoke renders differently for two players, so what might be obscuring your vision could be completely clear for the enemy, and vice versa.</li>
    <li>When you get to the smaller safe zones, normally around the last 10 or 15, you want to try and quickly eliminate anyone you see first - if they survive, it's only a small area, so you're likely to bump into them again later and there's no guarantee they won't get the drop on you instead.</li><br>
